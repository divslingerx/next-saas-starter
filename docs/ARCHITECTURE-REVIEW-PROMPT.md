# Architecture Review Prompt for AI Analysis

## Context and Request

You are being asked to conduct a comprehensive architectural review of a monorepo platform that enables building multiple vertical SaaS applications. Please analyze the codebase thoroughly and provide detailed feedback on architecture, performance, potential issues, and recommendations.

## Platform Overview and Use Case

### Primary Use Case
We are building a **multi-app platform** that can spin up different vertical applications from the same codebase. Think of it as our own internal Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Current target applications include:

1. **E-commerce Platform** - Full online store with CRM capabilities
2. **Music Artist Admin Panel** - Artist management, royalties, release tracking
3. **Future Verticals** - SaaS dashboards, Real Estate CRM, Healthcare Practice Manager, etc.

### Key Requirements
- **Multi-tenancy**: Each app instance has its own organizations and users
- **Flexible Schema**: Apps can define custom objects and properties without code changes
- **Shared Infrastructure**: All apps share identity, auth, email, and core services
- **Domain Separation**: Business logic is isolated by domain (CRM, Ecom, Marketing)
- **Property History**: Full audit trail for compliance and workflow automation
- **Workflow Automation**: Trigger actions based on property changes
- **B2B and B2C Support**: Handle both business and consumer use cases

### Technology Stack
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **API**: tRPC v11 for type-safe APIs
- **Auth**: Better Auth with extensive plugins
- **Email**: React Email with provider abstraction
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui

## Review Instructions

Please analyze the following aspects of our architecture:

### 1. Package Structure Analysis

Review our package organization and evaluate:

```
packages/
├── platform/         # Core infrastructure
│   ├── identity/    # Person and Organization entities
│   ├── objects/     # Flexible object system
│   ├── history/     # Property history tracking
│   └── automation/  # Workflow engine
├── crm/             # CRM domain
├── ecom/            # E-commerce domain
├── marketing/       # Marketing domain
├── email/           # Email infrastructure
├── api/             # tRPC API layer
├── auth/            # Authentication
├── db/              # Database layer
└── ui/              # Shared components
```

**Questions to answer:**
- Is the domain separation clean and appropriate?
- Are there any circular dependencies or coupling issues?
- Should any packages be further split or combined?
- Is the boundary between infrastructure and domain logic clear?

### 2. Database Schema Review

Evaluate our approach:
- **Unified Identity**: Single `person` table shared across all domains
- **Flexible Objects**: JSONB-based properties in `record` table
- **Property History**: Separate tables tracking all changes
- **Associations**: Polymorphic associations between any entities
- **Multi-tenancy**: Organization-based isolation

**Key tables to review:**
- `person` - Unified identity across all systems
- `organization` - Multi-tenant isolation
- `objectDefinition` - Defines flexible object types
- `record` - Stores all flexible object instances
- `propertyHistory` - Tracks every property change
- `association` - Relationships between entities

**Questions to answer:**
- Will JSONB properties scale for millions of records?
- Are the indexes optimal for our query patterns?
- Is the property history design efficient?
- Should we consider PostgreSQL schemas for tenant isolation?
- Any concerns with the polymorphic association pattern?

### 3. Performance Analysis

Identify potential bottlenecks:
- **JSONB Queries**: Filtering/sorting on dynamic properties
- **Property History**: Writing history on every change
- **Association Queries**: Complex relationship traversals
- **Multi-tenant Queries**: Ensuring organization isolation
- **Workflow Execution**: Triggering on property changes

**Specific concerns:**
- How will `properties->>'fieldName'` queries perform at scale?
- Is the property history write amplification acceptable?
- Should we implement caching? Where and how?
- Do we need read replicas for analytics queries?
- Should workflow execution be async via queue?

### 4. Architecture Patterns

Evaluate our patterns and suggest improvements:
- **Repository Pattern**: BaseRepository with type-safe CRUD
- **Service Layer**: Business logic in service classes
- **Flexible Object System**: Similar to HubSpot/Salesforce
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Separate packages per domain
- **Event Sourcing**: Property history as event stream

**Questions:**
- Is the repository pattern adding unnecessary abstraction?
- Should services be more functional vs class-based?
- Is the flexible object system the right choice vs concrete schemas?
- Are we following DDD principles correctly?
- Should we implement CQRS for read/write separation?

### 5. Code Quality and Maintainability

Review for:
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript usage
- **Code Duplication**: Repeated patterns that could be abstracted
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E approach
- **Documentation**: Code comments and architecture docs

### 6. Security Considerations

Evaluate:
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Can one org access another's data?
- **Property History**: Are sensitive changes properly tracked?
- **Flexible Properties**: SQL injection risks with JSONB queries?
- **Authentication**: Is Better Auth configured securely?
- **API Security**: Are tRPC procedures properly protected?

### 7. Scalability Assessment

Consider our growth path:
- **Current**: 10-100 organizations, 1K-10K records each
- **Near-term**: 1K organizations, 100K records each  
- **Long-term**: 10K+ organizations, 1M+ records each

**Questions:**
- At what point do we need to shard?
- Should we separate read/write databases?
- When do we need a caching layer?
- How do we handle workflow execution at scale?
- Should we consider microservices eventually?

### 8. Developer Experience

Evaluate:
- **Onboarding**: How easy is it to understand the architecture?
- **Adding Features**: Steps to add new domain objects
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type inference working?
- **Development Speed**: Any productivity bottlenecks?
- **Debugging**: Can developers easily trace issues?

## Specific Areas of Concern

Please pay special attention to:

1. **Property History Performance**: Every property change creates a history record. Will this scale?

2. **JSONB vs Columns**: We store all custom properties in JSONB. Should some be promoted to columns?

3. **Workflow Triggers**: Currently checking triggers synchronously. Should this be async?

4. **Association Pattern**: Using polymorphic associations. Better than junction tables?

5. **Multi-app Architecture**: Can the same codebase effectively serve different verticals?

## Additional Context for Review

### Current Pain Points We're Aware Of
1. Package compilation time in development
2. Complex type inference slowing TypeScript
3. Unclear where business logic should live
4. Property history might be over-engineered

### Questions We Need Answered
1. Should we use PostgreSQL schemas for multi-tenancy instead of organization_id?
2. Is JSONB the right choice for flexible properties or should we use EAV pattern?
3. Should workflows be in a separate service or embedded in the platform?
4. Is our domain separation correct or too granular?
5. Should we implement event sourcing fully or is property history enough?

### Future Considerations
- Planning to add real-time features (WebSockets)
- May need to support file attachments (S3 integration)
- Considering adding a GraphQL layer alongside tRPC
- Might need to support custom code execution for workflows
- Planning to add white-labeling capabilities
