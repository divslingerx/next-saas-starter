## Recommendations

### What We Need for V1
1. **Simple boot sequence** - Service initialization
2. **Configuration management** - Store settings, feature flags
3. **Health checks** - Monitoring endpoints

### What We DON'T Need
1. **Plugin loading** - No plugins in V1
2. **Dynamic routing** - Next.js handles this
3. **Plugin configuration** - Simplified to store config

### New Schema Needed
```typescript
// Configuration table for SHELL-003
configuration: {
  id, namespace, key, value, 
  encrypted, description, 
  updatedBy, updatedAt
}
```

## Impact on Timeline
- Original: 13 points (3 stories)
- Updated: 6 points (2 stories)

## Next Steps
1. Implement configuration schema
2. Build ConfigService
3. Create admin UI for settings
4. Add feature flag system
