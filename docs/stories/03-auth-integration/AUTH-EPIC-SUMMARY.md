# Authentication Integration Epic - V1 Summary

## Overview
The Auth epic focuses on integrating Better Auth with e-commerce specific requirements. Both stories remain relevant but have been updated to remove plugin dependencies.

## Story Status

### ✅ AUTH-001: Customer Account Integration - **KEEP (Updated)**
- **Purpose**: Link customers to auth system
- **Changes**: Focused on B2C/B2B integration instead of "org bridge"
- **New**: Added B2B multi-user support
- **Priority**: P0 - Critical for any user functionality
- **Points**: 6 (increased from 5 for B2B complexity)

### ✅ AUTH-002: Permission System - **KEEP (Updated)**
- **Purpose**: Role-based access control
- **Changes**: Removed plugin permissions, added e-commerce roles
- **New**: B2B company-level permissions
- **Priority**: P1 - Needed for admin and B2B
- **Points**: 5 (unchanged)

## Key Changes from Original

### What Changed
1. **No plugin permissions** - Focus on e-commerce roles
2. **B2B emphasis** - Multi-user companies with roles
3. **Simpler structure** - Role-based instead of granular plugin permissions
4. **Direct integration** - No abstraction layers

### What's New
1. **Customer-User linking** - Proper integration strategy
2. **Company accounts** - Multiple users per B2B customer
3. **Migration path** - For existing customers
4. **Permission caching** - Performance optimization

## Technical Requirements

### New Schema Elements Needed
```typescript
// For AUTH-001
customers.userId - Link to Better Auth

// New table for B2B
customerUsers: {
  customerId, userId, role, createdAt
}

// For AUTH-002 (might use Better Auth's built-in)
roles: { id, name, permissions[] }
userRoles: { userId, roleId }
```

## Implementation Order
1. **AUTH-001** first - Foundation for all user features
2. **AUTH-002** second - Builds on customer integration

## Impact on Other Stories
- **ECOM stories** - Depend on customer integration
- **ADMIN stories** - Depend on permission system
- **B2B stories** - Heavily depend on both

## Recommendations
1. Implement AUTH-001 early in Phase 1
2. Use Better Auth's features where possible
3. Keep permission system simple initially
4. Plan for SSO in future (B2B requirement)
