## Technical Implementation

### Service Structure
```typescript

    private cartService: CartService,
    private paymentService: PaymentService,
    private shippingService: ShippingService,

  ) {}
  
  async createSession(cartId: string): Promise<CheckoutSession>
  async updateCustomerInfo(sessionId: string, info: CustomerInfo)
  async setShippingAddress(sessionId: string, address: Address)
  async getShippingRates(sessionId: string): Promise<ShippingRate[]>
  async selectShippingMethod(sessionId: string, methodId: string)
  async createPaymentIntent(sessionId: string): Promise<PaymentIntent>
  async completeCheckout(sessionId: string): Promise<Order>
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Track checkout progress
interface CheckoutState {
  currentStep: CheckoutStep
  completedSteps: CheckoutStep[]
  sessionId: string
  expiresAt: Date
}
```

### Security Measures
- [ ] Session tokens with expiration

- [ ] Order summary sidebar
- [ ] Express checkout option

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Page load < 1 second
- [ ] Payment processing < 3 seconds
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for checkout
- [ ] Support for 100+ concurrent checkouts
- [ ] A/B testing capability

## Dependencies
- ✅ Cart system (ECOM-003)

## Notes
- Start with Stripe as the payment provider
- Consider PayPal integration for Phase 2
- Plan for Apple Pay/Google Pay in future
- Monitor checkout abandonment rates
- A/B test single vs multi-page checkout
