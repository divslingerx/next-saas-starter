# ⚠️ PLUGIN SYSTEM DEFERRED TO V2

## Decision Date: 2024-12-19

### Rationale
The plugin system has been deferred to V2 (or potentially indefinitely) to focus on delivering a working e-commerce platform faster. The architectural complexity of runtime plugin loading conflicts with Next.js's build-time optimization philosophy.

### Impact
All stories in this epic (CORE-001 through CORE-005) are deferred:
- CORE-001: Plugin Loader System
- CORE-002: Plugin Registry  
- CORE-003: Hook System
- CORE-004: Plugin Schema Management
- CORE-005: Plugin Dependency Resolver

### Alternative Approach for V1
- Direct implementation in packages
- Modular architecture without runtime plugins
- Feature flags for enabling/disabling functionality
- Well-defined service interfaces for future extensibility

### V2 Considerations
If plugin system is reconsidered for V2:
1. Separate plugin runtime service (not Next.js)
2. Build-time plugin integration
3. Simplified plugin model (npm packages)

## Migration Path
When/if we implement plugins in V2:
1. Extract services to plugin interfaces
2. Convert feature modules to plugins
3. Maintain backward compatibility
