- **Benefits**: 
  - Faster development
  - Better Next.js compatibility
  - Clearer dependencies
  - Easier testing

## Story Updates

### Updated Stories (Examples)
1. **ECOM-001**: Product Management
   - Removed plugin references
   - Added service layer details
   - Noted completed schemas
   - Added tRPC implementation

2. **ECOM-003**: Cart System

- DEV-002 (Plugin marketplace)
- PROPS-* (Custom properties)

## New Timeline

### Original Estimate
- 250-300 story points
- 6-8 months with small team

### V1 Estimate
- 150-180 story points
- 3-4 months with small team
- 40% time savings

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review updated PRIORITIES-V1.md
2. Start Phase 1 implementation (service layers)
3. Begin sprint planning

### Phase 1 Focus (Sprint 1-2)
- Product service layer
- Cart service layer
- Core tRPC routes
- Basic UI components

### Critical Path
1. Complete service implementations
2. Build customer-facing UI
3. Implement checkout with Stripe
4. Create admin dashboard
5. Launch MVP

## Technical Decisions

### Services Architecture
```
/packages/ecom/src/services/
  - product.service.ts
  - cart.service.ts
  - checkout.service.ts
  - customer.service.ts
  - order.service.ts
```

### API Structure
```
/packages/api/src/routers/
  - products.ts
  - cart.ts
  - checkout.ts
  - orders.ts
  - admin/
```

### Key Technologies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle
- **API**: tRPC (internal), REST (future)
- **Auth**: Better Auth
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Email**: Resend
- **UI**: shadcn/ui

## Success Metrics

### MVP (End of Phase 2)
- Browse products ✓
- Add to cart ✓
- Complete checkout ✓
- Manage products (admin) ✓

### V1 Release (End of Phase 6)
- Full e-commerce ✓
- Admin dashboard ✓
- Customer accounts ✓
- B2B support ✓
- Analytics ✓
- API access ✓

## Risk Mitigation
- **Plugin Removal**: Design services with future extensibility in mind
- **Timeline**: Aggressive but achievable with focused scope
- **Complexity**: Simplified architecture reduces technical risk

## Conclusion
The removal of the plugin system and completion of database schemas positions the project for rapid V1 development. The simplified architecture aligns better with Next.js capabilities while maintaining extensibility for future needs.
