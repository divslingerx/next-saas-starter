# CORE-001: Plugin Loader System

## Story
**As a** platform developer  
**I want** a plugin loading system  
**So that** the application can dynamically load and initialize plugins at runtime

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Plugin discovery from file system
- [ ] Plugin validation (required fields, version compatibility)
- [ ] Dependency resolution algorithm
- [ ] Priority-based loading order
- [ ] Error handling for failed plugins
- [ ] Hot reload support in development

## Technical Notes
```typescript
interface Plugin {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependsOn?: Record<string, string>;
  priority?: number;
  exports?: PluginExports;
}
```

- Use topological sort for dependencies
- Validate semantic versioning
- Create PluginManager singleton
- Support both ESM and CJS plugins

## Dependencies
None - this is the foundational story
